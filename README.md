# Python Programming Tasks

This repository contains two beginner-friendly Python programs:

1. **Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd**
2. **Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop**

---

## ✅ Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes an integer input from the user.
2. Checks whether the number is even or odd using an `if-else` statement.
3. Displays the result accordingly.

### 🧠 Logic:
- If a number is divisible by 2 (`number % 2 == 0`), it is **Even**.
- Otherwise, it is **Odd**.

### 🖥️ Sample Output:
Enter number: 56
56 is an Even Number

## ✅ Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Uses a `for` loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2. Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3. Displays the final sum.

### 🧠 Logic:
- Start with a `total_sum = 0`
- Use a loop from 1 to 50 and keep adding each number to the total.

### 🖥️ Sample Output:
Total sum of number from 0 to 50 is:  1275
